<h1>Application (Simplex Method)</h1>
<p>Real-world applications of the Simplex method in linear programming.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent real-world applications of the Simplex Method is in logistics and supply chain management. Companies use the Simplex Method to optimize their supply chain operations by minimizing transportation costs, managing inventory levels, and scheduling deliveries efficiently. For example, a logistics company might use the Simplex Method to determine the most cost-effective way to transport goods from multiple warehouses to numerous retail stores while adhering to constraints like delivery deadlines, warehouse capacities, and transportation costs. This ensures that the company operates efficiently, reduces costs, and meets customer demands effectively.</p>
